.SH SYNOPSIS

STATSF_SET_TMP_FILE_AE(ptr, c, new_tmp_file_element)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr                     Pointer to a statsf_t structure
c                       Subscript to tmp_file array
new_tmp_file_element    New value for tmp_file[c]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for tmp_file array elements.  Use this macro to set
an element of tmp_file in a statsf_t structure from functions
that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the statsf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function statsf_set_tmp_file_ae(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_tmp_file_element is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
statsf_t        statsf;
size_t          c;
FILE *          new_tmp_file_element;

STATSF_SET_TMP_FILE_AE(&statsf, c, new_tmp_file_element);
