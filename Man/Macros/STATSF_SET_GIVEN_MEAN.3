.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf 
.na
STATSF_SET_GIVEN_MEAN(ptr, new_given_mean)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
ptr             Pointer to a statsf_t structure
new_given_mean  New value for given_mean
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for given_mean.  Use this macro to set given_mean in
a statsf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the statsf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function statsf_set_given_mean(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_given_mean is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
statsf_t        statsf;
double          new_given_mean;

STATSF_SET_GIVEN_MEAN(&statsf, new_given_mean);
.ad
.fi
