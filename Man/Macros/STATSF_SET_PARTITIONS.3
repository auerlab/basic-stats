.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for partitions.  Use this macro to set partitions in
a statsf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the statsf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function statsf_set_partitions(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_partitions is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
statsf_t        statsf;
unsigned        new_partitions;

STATSF_SET_PARTITIONS(&statsf, new_partitions);
.ad
.fi
