.SH SYNOPSIS

.na
STATSF_SET_NUM_COUNT(ptr, new_num_count)
.ad

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf

ptr             Pointer to a statsf_t structure
new_num_count   New value for num_count
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator macro for num_count.  Use this macro to set num_count in
a statsf_t structure from functions that are not members of the class.
This allows separation of implementation from interface.  While the
implementation of the statsf_t structure may change, effort is made to
preserve the API of functions and macros used to access it.

Note that there is an equivalent function statsf_set_num_count(), which performs
this function with data verification.  Use the function version for more
robust code with a slight performance penalty if the value of
new_num_count is not validated by other means.

.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
.na
statsf_t        statsf;
size_t          new_num_count;

STATSF_SET_NUM_COUNT(&statsf, new_num_count);
.ad
.fi
