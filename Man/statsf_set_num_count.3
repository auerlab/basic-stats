.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     statsf_set_num_count(statsf_t *statsf_ptr, size_t new_num_count)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.nf
.na
statsf_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_num_count   The new value for num_count
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for num_count member in a statsf_t structure.
Use this function to set num_count in a statsf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
num_count is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_num_count is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

STATSF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
STATSF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

statsf_t        statsf;
size_t          new_num_count;

if ( statsf_set_num_count(&statsf, new_num_count) == STATSF_DATA_OK )
{
}
