.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
int     statsf_set_partitions(statsf_t *statsf_ptr, unsigned new_partitions)

.SH ARGUMENTS

statsf_ptr      Pointer to the structure to set
new_partitions  The new value for partitions
.ad
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

Mutator for partitions member in a statsf_t structure.
Use this function to set partitions in a statsf_t variable
from non-member functions.  This function performs a direct
assignment for scalar or pointer structure members.  If
partitions is a pointer, data previously pointed to should
generally be freed before calling this function to avoid memory
leaks.

Note that there is an equivalent macro (), which performs
this function with no data verification or function call overhead.
Use the macro version to maximize performance where the validity
of new_partitions is guaranteed by other means.

.SH RETURN VALUES

STATSF_DATA_OK if the new value is acceptable and assigned
STATSF_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE otherwise

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
.na

statsf_t        statsf;
unsigned        new_partitions;

if ( statsf_set_partitions(&statsf, new_partitions) == STATSF_DATA_OK )
{
